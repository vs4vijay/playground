# Hermes Agent on Render, pre-baked with Render tooling.
#
# Extends the upstream NousResearch/hermes-agent image with:
#   - A bundle of Render-focused skills mounted via skills.external_dirs
#   - A boot-time patcher that registers the Render MCP server in
#     config.yaml (idempotent; never overwrites user edits)
#
# We deliberately do NOT install the `render` CLI. This image is configured
# around the Render MCP server; installing extra CLIs should be a conscious
# operator choice, not something the agent does as an automatic fallback.
#
# Pin the upstream tag here. Bump and redeploy to upgrade Hermes.

# Workarounds for upstream issues that prevent the dashboard's Chat tab
# from connecting on hosted deploys. Baked into the image so the runtime
# command stays simple. See render.yaml comments + the README for context.
#   - chown: dashboard runs as `hermes` but ui-tui/ + node_modules/ ship root-owned
#   - touch ink-bundle.js: short-circuits _hermes_ink_bundle_stale()
#   - touch entry.js: bumps mtime above source .ts files so _tui_build_needed() returns False
